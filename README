1. Introduction

The Judiciary Information System (JIS) is a web-based application designed to manage court cases digitally and provide easy access to past case records for judges and lawyers. The system helps the registrar record case details, schedule hearings, track adjournments, and maintain complete case histories.

2. Objectives

To maintain digital records of all court cases.

To automate hearing scheduling and show available slots.

To allow judges and lawyers to search and view old cases.

To maintain transparency through detailed case histories.

To charge lawyers for viewing past cases.

3. Key Features
A. Case Registration

Registrar enters: defendant details, crime details, arrest information, judge, prosecutor, starting date, and expected completion date.

System generates a unique Case Identification Number (CIN).

B. Hearing Scheduling

System shows vacant time slots for hearings on working days.

Supports adjournment entries and new hearing dates.

Allows updating hearing summaries after each session.

C. Queries Available to Registrar

Pending Cases
List sorted by CIN with defendant info, crime details, lawyer, prosecutor, and judge.

Resolved Cases in a Time Period
Lists case start date, CIN, judgment date, judge name, and summary.

Cases Scheduled for a Particular Date

Status of a Case by CIN
Full case history, hearings, adjournments, and judgment.

D. Access to Past Cases

Judges: free access to all past cases.

Lawyers: charged per case view.

Keyword-based search for case histories.

E. User Management

Registrar can create/delete accounts for judges, lawyers, and staff.

Tracks number of cases each lawyer has viewed (for billing).

4. Technology Stack Used
Frontend Technologies
HTML

Used to create the structure of all web pages including case forms, search pages, login pages, and tables.

CSS

Adds styling, layout, fonts, spacing, tables formatting, and responsive UI design suitable for judicial environments.

JavaScript

Used on client-side for validation, dynamic updates, DOM manipulation, and sending AJAX requests to the server.

Backend Technologies
Node.js

Server-side runtime environment.

Handles core logic like:

Case registration

Hearing scheduling

Adjournment updates

User login and authentication

Tracking lawyer case views

Express.js

Framework for creating REST APIs.

Used for routing operations such as:

Adding a case

Fetching pending cases

Searching old cases

Scheduling hearings

Managing user accounts

Database
MongoDB

Stores all case-related data in collections such as:

Cases

Hearings

Judgments

Users (judges, lawyers, staff)

Logs (lawyer usage tracking)

Benefits of MongoDB:

Flexible schema (works well for complex case data)

Fast search for keyword-based case retrieval

Supports large datasets over years of case history

5. Conclusion

The Judiciary Information System (JIS) improves efficiency in court management by automating case tracking, hearing scheduling, and digital case storage. With a modern web-based architecture using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the system provides easy access to judicial information while maintaining security and accountability.lps the registrar record case details, schedule hearings, track adjournments, and maintain complete case histories.
